# Assessment Documentation

The main goal of this assessment is to create a React Application using TypeScript in order to show a list of countries, and then showing for each country the data associated to it.

## Instructions

Fork the current repository and start the skeleton executing the following scripts:

```s
yarn install
yarn start
```

The application provides a basic setup using **Create React App** with a typescript template.

The description of the API is available [here](https://restcountries.eu/?ref=public-apis)
In case above apis doesnt work, make use of dummy json that you would like to show up with below details.

## Requirements

During the implementation, you must accomplish the following functional and technical requirements

### Tech Requirements

1. You must use Hooks and Functional Components
2. You must use TypeScript for typing your methods, your components and the data structures associated
3. You must not use any third party JavaScript utility libraries
4. You can use any style approach you prefer (CSS, CSS Preprocessors, Styled Components, etc.)
5. You can use any library you like for fetching the data (also the builtin fetch would be totally fine)
6. You can use any testing library for unit testing some of your code (Jest is already setup in the project and ready to be executed through the command `yarn test`)

### Functional Requirements

1. Show a main page with the list of countries, allowing filtering and sorting (asc/desc) by the population of the capital city of the country

2. Selecting a country, show the following information of the country:

   1. Capital City with the related info
   2. Language
   3. Currency

3. Provide a way to filter out countries by name or code

4. Provide a way to sort countries (asc/desc) by the population of its capital city

5. Add tests associated to the filter and sorting features

6. Add styles for displaying the items in a user friendly way
